    <h1>R1: A Handmade Web</h1>

    <p>This article by J. R. Carpenter discusses the early days of web creation and the differences between the modern corporate-driven internet and the more organic, manually coded web pages from the past. Carpenter advocates for the preservation and active engagement with the creation of web pages, referencing the historical context, the physical labor involved, and the resistance against the highly commercialized nature of the modern internet. The thesis highlights the historical significance and value of handmade web pages, which were individually crafted, challenged conventions, and showcased novel ideas allowing for a more personal and experimental approach to online expression. The author emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the past methods of web creation.

<p>The article suggests that the handmade web represents a form of resistance against the homogenization and commercialization of the internet that encourage standardized design approaches. The resistance lies in the act of hand-coding, self-publishing experimental web art, and overall resisting the conventions imposed by highly commercialized online spaces. The article prompts readers to reconsider the web's evolution, encouraging a return to a more personalized, experimental, and intimate online experience.</p>
       
       <p> Carpenter identifies key forms of web physicality that involve tactile engagement with physical interfaces like touchscreens and trackpads. How our bodies interact with digital interfaces showcase the interconnectedness between the virtual and physical realms. In my personal experience with creating wearable technology, considering this relationship is essential in the design process. For instance, people are accustomed to movements such as scrolling clicking and swiping when interacting with technology, mainly screens, therefore, to ensure a device is intuitive and accessible, designers must work around these conventions.</p>
